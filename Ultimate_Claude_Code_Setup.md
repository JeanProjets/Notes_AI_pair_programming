What does your "Ultimate" Claude Code setup actually look like?
Productivity
I’m looking for the tricks that turn “it works” into “wow, that shipped itself.” If you’ve built a setup you trust on real deadlines, I’d love to hear how you’ve wired it up.

MCP Stack

Which 2–3 servers stay in your daily rotation, and why?

Any sleeper MCPs that quietly solve a painful problem?

Token + stability hacks when they’re all chatting at once?

Sneaky claude.md wins

Non obvious directives or role frames that boosted consistency.

Tricks for locking in polished, exec-ready output.

Task() choreography

Patterns for agents sharing state without stepping on each other.

Pain points you wish someone had flagged sooner.

Multi LLM one-two punch

Workflows where Claude + Gemini/OpenAI/etc. do different jobs (not just critique loops).

How you decide who owns which slice.

Force multipliers

Shell scripts, Git hooks, dashboards—anything that makes Claude hit harder.

Keeping long jobs on mission without babysitting.

“If I knew then…”

One hard won lesson that would’ve saved you a weekend of cursing.

Not looking for free consulting lol!! I’m just here to trade ideas. I’ll drop my own builds in the comments. Excited to see what setups everyone rates as “best.”

Thanks in advance! Lets chop it up.
