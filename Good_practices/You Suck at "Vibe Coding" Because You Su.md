You Suck at "Vibe Coding" Because You Suck at Coding
Senior SWE here. I maintain systems doing millions monthly. I use Claude Code 90% of the time.

While you're complaining your for-loops are going nuts, I'm shipping 10x faster with better tests. The problem isn't vibe coding. The problem is you.

1. Your Prompts Are Garbage

"Fix my auth bug" isn't a prompt. It's a prayer. Tell the AI WHERE the problem is. Show the error. Explain what should happen. If you can't explain the problem clearly, that's on you.

2. Stop Using Autoaccept

Anyone using autoaccept deserves their bugs. READ EVERY LINE. Always. It's a suggestion, not gospel.

3. Less Code = Better Code

Saw Paul Graham praising some founder for generating 10k lines daily with AI. Good luck maintaining that mess. Good engineering means minimal changes. If your AI rewrites half your codebase for one feature, you're doing it wrong.

4. Fix Your Folder Structure

Your repo is a mess. That's why AI gets confused. Make it simple: feats/[feature-name]/[files]. If a human can't scan it quickly, neither can AI.

5. It's a Tool, Not Magic

"Vibe coding is bad" is like saying "knives are dangerous." Yeah, if you're an idiot with them. Learn to use the tool properly.

6. Use Voice for Prompts

Pro tip most of you miss: dictate your prompts. You give 3x more context speaking vs typing. I use writevoice.io (I built it). WillowVoice and Flow work too. When you speak, you naturally explain edge cases and assumptions you'd skip when typing.

7. Stop Mixing Features in One Chat

Long conversations about 3 different features confuse the AI. Change chats between features. If you tell AI "I ate strawberries and now I'm late for school, what's my salary?" it'll think you're a farmer. Context switching breaks AI just like it breaks humans. There's research on this.

8. Document Changes, But Keep It Short

Keep a log file. Write one-sentence updates after each feature/big change. That's it. These breadcrumbs save hours of explaining context later.

Stop blaming the tool. Start learning how to use it.
