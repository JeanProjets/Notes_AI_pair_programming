Found a magic way to work with Claude
Productivity
I never thought something as simple as having 3 divided agents with their respective commands would change the results so dramatically.

My first agent is the INVESTIGATOR, to whom I explain my entire problem and who is in charge of investigating the documentation and codebase. Then, it generates a PROBLEM.md file with phases and the necessary documentation to solve the problem (provide context). I realized that Claude is much faster at reading documentation with memory than reading codebase, so the investigator spends 80% of its context investigating the problem and what documentation is necessary to solve it. Then, in PROBLEM.md, it proceeds to give the context, analysis, and indicated steps and delegates to EXECUTER.

EXECUTER is in charge of reading the documentation, following the exact steps in PROBLEM.md, and proceeding with the solution.

Then, I have a TESTER which proceeds to generate scripts, validate the codebase changed by executer, and provide feedback on whether the problem was 100% solved.

This workflow has been a game-changer for complex development tasks. The separation of concerns allows each agent to focus on what it does best, and the structured handoff via PROBLEM.md ensures nothing gets lost in translation.

Has anyone else experimented with multi-agent workflows like this? I'd love to hear about other approaches that have worked well for you!

UPDATE: As a lot of people asked for the prompts and commands, I created a Drive folder. The commands are quiet bit different because made some updates (INVESTIGATOR named PLANNER). Also includes DOCUMENTER, VERIFIER agents which I also use a lot, and the README file. Link of the Drive folder. Be aware that is adapted to my project which is in Typescript, React. You should adapt it to yours.
